# TikZ_Collection
Collection of my personal TikZ diagrams. Each **.tex** file is a standalone.   
To generate the pdf, use the command line `pdflatex whatever.tex`.  

One may want to use the command line `rm ./*.log ./*.aux` in the corresponding folder to clean additionnal files due to the pdf generation.
